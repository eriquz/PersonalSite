                <h3>Project Sneaker</h3>
                <h4 class="text-muted"> This is an example of a Full Stack Two Tier MVC e-commerce design and build with HTML5, CSS3, C#, ASP.Net JavaScript, jQuery, SQL, XML, Bootstrap.</h4>
                <p>
                    This project was completed during the Advanced MVC portion of Centriq Training. It is a representation of my ability to build a full stack dynamic web application with an Entity Framework tied to its own Database. The template selection for this project was definitely a style choice and not one made of convenience. It truly tested my debugging skills and styling capabilities at times. I am pleased with the outcome and am glad that I stuck with my wireframe and original plan to produce this application.

                <p>
                    This project was completed during the Middle Tier Development portion of Centriq Training. It is a representation of my ability to create a dungeon crawler game, that shows multi-stage processes broken down into steps to design complex logical structures.

                <p>
                    This project was completed during the Front-End Development portion of Centriq Training. It is a representation of my ability to create a website from scratch using only HTML and CSS. We were given a wireframe as a guide and to imagine we were building a website for a small business that provides instructional courses.
